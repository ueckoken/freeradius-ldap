#  Per-socket client lists.  The configuration entries are exactly
#  the same as above, but they are nested inside of a section.
#
#  You can have as many per-socket client lists as you have "listen"
#  sections, or you can re-use a list among multiple "listen" sections.
#
#  Un-comment this section, and edit a "listen" section to add:
#  "clients = per_socket_clients".  That IP address/port combination
#  will then accept ONLY the clients listed in this section.
#
#  There are additional considerations when using clients from SQL.
#
#  A client can be link to a virtual server via modules such as SQL.
#  This link is done via the following process:
#
#  If there is no listener in a virtual server, SQL clients are added
#  to the global list for that virtual server.
#
#  If there is a listener, and the first listener does not have a
#  "clients=..." configuration item, SQL clients are added to the
#  global list.
#
#  If there is a listener, and the first one does have a "clients=..."
#  configuration item, SQL clients are added to that list.  The client
#  { ...} ` configured in that list are also added for that listener.
#
#  The only issue is if you have multiple listeners in a virtual
#  server, each with a different client list, then the SQL clients are
#  added only to the first listener.
